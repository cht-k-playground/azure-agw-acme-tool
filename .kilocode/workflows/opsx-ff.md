Fast-forward through artifact creation — generate everything needed to start implementation in one go.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user just ran `/opsx:new`
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

2. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

3. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you — do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you — do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `outputPath`: Where to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints — but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "✓ Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

4. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/opsx:apply` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain — follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file — fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user — but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists but artifacts are incomplete, continue from where it left off
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
