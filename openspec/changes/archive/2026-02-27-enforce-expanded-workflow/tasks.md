# Tasks: enforce-expanded-workflow

- [x] **Task 1 — Update AGENTS.md Section 1**: Remove the `/opsx:propose` shortcut recommendation from the preferred workflow description. Keep the five-step workflow table intact; remove only the `> **Shortcut**` callout that presents `/opsx:propose` as an alternative entry point.

- [x] **Task 2 — Update AGENTS.md Section 6**: In the "Just Fix" guidance steps, replace the instruction to run `/opsx:propose <descriptive-name>` with the explicit two-step sequence `/opsx:new <descriptive-name>` followed by `/opsx:ff`.

- [x] **Task 3 — Update AGENTS.md Section 7**: In the quoted agent response, replace `"Proceeding with \`/opsx:propose\`."` with `"Proceeding with \`/opsx:new\` + \`/opsx:ff\`."` so the response matches the Expanded Mode workflow.

- [x] **Task 4 — Update AGENTS.md Slash Command Reference table**: Add an annotation to the `/opsx:propose` row indicating it is a `core`-profile shortcut not used in this project (e.g., append `_(core-profile shortcut — not used in this project)_` to the Purpose column).

- [x] **Task 5 — Update ROADMAP.md**: Replace all references to `/opsx:propose` with `/opsx:new → /opsx:ff` in the usage instructions section. This affects the workflow description on approximately lines 4, 8, and 11 of that section.
